Visit the app: https://kemeldev.github.io/Ecommerce/

This is a non-commercial Ecommerce site app that uses React

# Overview 

### Frontend
The frontend of our app is built entirely with React. It fetches and displays data from a mock database using a JSON file. This data is dynamically handled throughout the app, providing users with an immersive and interactive shopping experience. Our goal is to simulate the functionalities and user interface of a real ecommerce site.

### Backend
Current Progress
We are actively working on integrating a backend system into our Ecommerce App. The backend is being developed using C#, .NET, and MySQL Server. This integration aims to elevate our app to a more realistic and scalable platform, closely resembling real-world ecommerce scenarios.

#### Planned Features
Data Storage: Our backend will manage the storage of product, user, and order data, ensuring efficient retrieval and management.

#### Authentication and Authorization: 
We are implementing a secure login system with authentication and authorization functionalities to safeguard user accounts and data.

#### Payment Integration:
Our app will feature a payment system integrated with a real API, allowing users to complete transactions seamlessly and securely.
